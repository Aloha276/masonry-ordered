    - <h3>Desiderata</h3> by Max Ehrmann
  - Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.
  - As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
  - Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
  - Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.
  - If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
  - Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

    - Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
  - Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery.
  - But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.
  - Be yourself.
  - Especially do not feign affection.
  - Neither be cynical about love, for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.
  - Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
  - Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
  - But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
  - Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
  - Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.
  - You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.
  - And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
  - Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.
  - And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.
  - With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.
  - Be cheerful.

    - Strive to be happy.
